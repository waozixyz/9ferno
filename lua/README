NAME
     lua - Lua 5.4 VM for Inferno/Limbo

SYNOPSIS
     lua [ options ] [ script [ args ] ]

DESCRIPTION
     Lua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
     This implementation runs on Inferno/Limbo as a .dis module.

     Options:
       -e stat  Execute string 'stat'
       -i       Enter interactive mode after executing scripts
       -v       Show version information
       -h       Show this help

     In interactive mode:
       Empty line clears multi-line buffer
       EOF (Ctrl-D) exits

EXAMPLES
     # Run a script
     lua hello.lua

     # Execute expression
     lua -e "print('Hello, World!')"

     # Interactive REPL
     lua

     # Execute from stdin
     lua < script.lua

BUGS
     Only the core VM is implemented.  Standard libraries are loaded through
     the generic module loading system.
